Account Setup Documentation

Administrator Role

My role as the administrator is to manage system configuration, create and maintain user accounts, install approved software, and enforce security settings. The administrator account is used only when elevated access is required and not for daily activities.

Why Administrator Access Is Restricted

Administrator access is restricted to reduce the risk of accidental system changes, security misconfigurations, and malware execution. Limiting admin usage supports least privilege and helps protect system stability and data integrity.

What Administrator Privileges Allow

Administrator privileges allow system-level changes including installing and removing software, modifying system settings, managing user accounts, configuring security policies, and controlling access to protected system resources.
